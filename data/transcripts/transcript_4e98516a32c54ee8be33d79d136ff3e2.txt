<Person1>Welcome to PODCASTIFY - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast.  So, this assessment of needs law in Ireland, huh?  Ninety hours for an assessment? That's…intense.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  And it's supposed to be done in six months, but, uh, only 7% are completed in that timeframe.  It's a major backlog.</Person2>
<Person1>It sounds like a logistical nightmare.  A finite number of therapists, as the Taoiseach said. I mean, yeah, that's- that's gotta be a huge bottleneck.</Person1>
<Person2>Absolutely.  And this young activist, Cara Darmody, is really bringing it to light.  Fourteen years old, protesting at the Dáil.  Pretty powerful stuff.</Person2>
<Person1>Wow.  Fourteen.  Good for her!  She's calling it a “national crisis,” and, you know what?  She might be right.</Person1>
<Person2>It sounds like it. Thousands of kids waiting.  It’s heartbreaking, honestly.  The law says six months, but some families wait years.  Years!</Person2>
<Person1>It's just not right. This assessment is crucial for kids to get the services they need.  So, if they're waiting years…I mean, what are they supposed to do in the meantime?</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly! And it disproportionately affects low-income families, who may not have the resources to…to seek alternative support.</Person2>
<Person1>It’s creating even more inequality.  This whole situation just seems…untenable, like the Taoiseach said.  Something has to change.</Person1>
<Person2>He’s suggesting changes to the legislation, but, um, what those changes will be…well, that remains to be seen.  Hopefully, it leads to real solutions.</Person2>
<Person1>So, this young activist, Cara Darmody— just fourteen—staging a 50-hour protest?  Wow.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  At the Dáil, no less.  Talk about making your voice heard.  A 50-hour protest…that takes dedication.</Person2>
<Person1>Fifty hours.  Fifty hours.  That's, um, that's a long time for anyone to protest, let alone a fourteen-year-old.</Person1>
<Person2>Seriously.  She's got exams coming up, too.  Imagine trying to study while staging a protest.  That takes some serious dedication.</Person2>
<Person1>It really does.  And, uh, she brought sweets and chocolate to get her through? I mean, that's— that's just…classic.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  Fueling the fight for change with sugar. I love it.  But, you know, it’s not just a one-off thing with her.</Person2>
<Person1>She's not just protesting, she's— she's meeting with party leaders, too?  At fourteen?  Wow.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah! Right?  Directly raising her concerns. That's… that's impressive.  Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald’s backing her up, too.  Calling her exceptional.</Person2>
<Person1>Well, she is.  "Comply with the law."  Simple demand, powerful message.</Person1>
<Person2>McDonald’s talking about three-year waits.  Three years! For an assessment?  It's- it's ridiculous.  “Waiting times that would make your eyes water,” she said. It’s true.</Person2>
<Person1>So, uh, Mary Lou McDonald is really laying down the law here, huh?  Calling the HSE experience “hell” for parents?  Strong words.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah.  And quoting a mother whose son’s been waiting two years for services?  It’s just… unacceptable.</Person2>
<Person1>So, she— she’s also pledging that there won't be 25,000 kids waiting by the end of the year?  As predicted by the HSE?  That's… a bold promise.</Person1>
<Person2>It is.  A very bold promise.  And the Minister for Disability, Hildegarde Naughton, is calling it an “absolute priority.”  So, hopefully, something will actually get done.</Person2>
<Person1>Ten million Euros, huh?  That’s… something, at least.  Six hundred fifty percent increase in assessments?  But, uh, still not enough, as the Minister said.  I mean…</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah.  It’s a drop in the bucket, really.  They need more therapists, like she said.  “Across the board.”</Person2>
<Person1>Ten million Euros.  It’s— it’s a start, I guess. But six hundred fifty percent increase in assessments and it’s still not enough?  Something’s seriously wrong here.</Person1>
<Person2>Right?  They need way more therapists, like the Minister said. “Across the board.” And, um, you know, this isn’t a new problem either.  Apparently, Cara Darmody started campaigning about this when she was ten?  Ten!</Person2>
<Person1>Ten years old?  Wow.  That’s… that’s unbelievable.  She’s been fighting this for years.  And someone actually asked— and I can’t believe this— if her actions are needed “to shame this Government into action?”  Seriously?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah.  Shameful, isn’t it? And Lorraine Dempsey, former CEO of Inclusion Ireland— she’s calling it a problem of the Government’s making.  Been an issue since 2010, apparently.  A thousand kids waiting back then.  Now…thousands more.</Person2>
<Person1>So, uh, it's— it's a real catch-22, isn’t it?  Kids have a legal right to these assessments, but…</Person1>
<Person2>But there just aren’t enough therapists to actually do them!  “In reality— we don’t have the people.”  I mean, that’s— that’s the crux of the problem, right?</Person2>
<Person1>It is.  And what’s the solution?  More therapists, obviously. But how do you get more therapists?  That’s the million-dollar question.</Person1>
<Person2>Well, she’s suggesting increasing third-level places, right?  Getting more people into those programs.  Makes sense.</Person2>
<Person1>Yeah.  And career guidance in schools!  Start ‘em young, right?  Get kids interested in healthcare early.</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly.  Plant that seed. Show them the possibilities.  It’s— it's a long-term solution, though.  It’s not gonna fix the immediate backlog.</Person2>
<Person1>No, definitely not a quick fix.  But it’s a start, right?  Gotta start somewhere.  And urging the government to act urgently…well, that’s important too.</Person1>
<Person2>Absolutely. Keep the pressure on.  Because this is impacting real kids, real families.  It’s— it’s just not right. Thanks for tuning into PODCASTIFY, folks! We appreciate you listening.</Person2>
<Person1>And we hope you'll join us next time.  Take care, everyone!  Bye for now!</Person1>

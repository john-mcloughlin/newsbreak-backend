<Person1>Welcome to PODCASTIFY - Your Personal Generative AI Podcast.  So, this assessment of needs law in Ireland, sounds like it's causing a real bottleneck.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, huge backlog.  Ninety hours for an assessment? That's insane! And they're supposed to be done within six months?  Six months!</Person2>
<Person1>It's a tough situation, right?  Limited therapists, huge demand…    Taoiseach Micheál Martin is suggesting a change in the law.</Person1>
<Person2>Makes sense.  Something has to give.  But, what kind of change are we talking about?</Person2>
<Person1>Well, that's what we need to unpack.  He mentioned the current system isn't sustainable, so…</Person1>
<Person2>Right, not sustainable.  Finite number of therapists, he said.  So, either they need more therapists, or…?</Person2>
<Person1>Or the assessment process needs to be streamlined, I guess.  Possibly both.</Person1>
<Person2>And in the middle of all this, you have this incredible 14-year-old, Cara Darmody, protesting at the Dáil.</Person2>
<Person1>Fifty-hour protest!  Wow.  Talk about dedication. She's witnessed this firsthand, clearly.</Person1>
<Person2>Absolutely.  She's saying the government's breaking the law by not meeting that six-month deadline.</Person2>
<Person1>And she's right, from what I understand.  Seven percent of cases met the deadline last year? That's… abysmal.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah.  Over 15,000 kids waiting.  It's a crisis, just like she says. A national crisis.</Person2>
<Person1>So, this young woman, Cara,  fifty-hour protest?  That's powerful.</Person1>
<Person2>Incredibly powerful.  Fourteen years old, calling out the government…  "Breaking the law," she says.</Person2>
<Person1>And she's bringing sweets and chocolate to get her through?    Fourteen, right?  That's just…</Person1>
<Person2>It's heartbreaking, and inspiring at the same time.  Studying for exams while protesting?  Wow.</Person2>
<Person1>This isn't her first protest either.  Apparently she's been campaigning for a while now.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, inspired by her family's own experiences. Makes it even more powerful, doesn't it?</Person2>
<Person1>So, Mary Lou McDonald, Sinn Féin leader, right?  She's calling Cara exceptional.  And her demand?  Simple: follow the law.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, comply with the law.    Makes sense.  The six-month deadline?  It's not being met.  It's law, but…</Person2>
<Person1>Not happening. McDonald's talking about three-year waits! Three years?  That's…unacceptable.</Person1>
<Person2>Absolutely unacceptable. "Waiting times would make your eyes water," she says.  Powerful statement.</Person2>
<Person1>So, Mary Lou McDonald, she's quoting parents, right? Calling the HSE experience "hell."</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, "hell."  And another mother, two-year wait for services.    Tough stuff.</Person2>
<Person1>McDonald's demanding timely services.  Desperately needed, she says.</Person1>
<Person2>Right, and praising Cara Darmody's stamina.  Even reading Cara's remarks.</Person2>
<Person1>Nice touch.  So, the government won't oppose this?   What's Minister Foley saying?</Person1>
<Person2>Foley admits the system's broken.  "Broken," but she's committing to fixing it.  Streamlining, she says.</Person2>
<Person1>Streamlining?  How so?</Person1>
<Person2>Well, removing the assessment requirement for Domiciliary Care Allowance. And for social housing too.</Person2>
<Person1>So, wait, Foley's saying they'll remove the assessment requirement for Domiciliary Care Allowance and social housing?    That's… a pretty big change.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, pretty significant.  And she's also guaranteeing there won't be 25,000 kids waiting by the end of the year.  Bold statement.</Person2>
<Person1>Twenty-five thousand?  Wow.    So, what about Hildegarde Naughton, the Minister of State for Disability? What's she saying?</Person1>
<Person2>Naughton's calling this waiting list issue an "absolute priority."    She wants more therapists, obviously.</Person2>
<Person1>Ten million Euros, huh?  For private assessments?  That's… something, at least.</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, something.  Six hundred fifty percent increase in assessments? Sounds impressive, but…</Person2>
<Person1>But still not enough, right?  Naughton herself admits it.</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly. "Not enough."    It's not just about the waiting list, she says.  More therapists, right?</Person2>
<Person1>Across the board, yeah.  Makes sense.  What about Ivana Bacik?  What's she saying?</Person1>
<Person2>Bacik wants a constructive plan.  To address the waiting lists and delays, you know?</Person2>
<Person1>Chronic delays.  Right.  No step change, she says?  Meaning…?</Person1>
<Person2>Meaning what's being done isn't enough.  Not even close, I'd guess.  And Cian O'Callaghan? He's weighing in too.</Person2>
<Person1>Oh?  What's he saying?</Person1>
<Person2>No child should have to protest for basic services.    Pretty powerful statement, right?</Person2>
<Person1>He's right, isn't he? O'Callaghan.  No child should have to protest.  For basic services.  Ten years old when she started campaigning?  Wow.</Person1>
<Person2>Ten?  That's…   That's unbelievable. "To shame this Government into action?"  He's asking the right questions.</Person2>
<Person1>And Lorraine Dempsey?  Inclusion Ireland CEO.  She's saying this is the government's fault.  A problem of their making.  Since 2010?  A thousand kids waiting back then?</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah. And now it's over fifteen thousand.  Cannibalised, she says.  By not addressing pay parity.  Section 38 and 39 services.  Makes sense. And not enough training places for therapists either.</Person2>
<Person1>So, this assessment bottleneck, it's a real problem.  A legal right, but…</Person1>
<Person2>Yeah, but no resources.  No therapists. "We don't have the people," she says.  Rightfully so.</Person2>
<Person1>It's impacting interventions, too, right?   Delays, backlogs…</Person1>
<Person2>Exactly.  And she's pushing for government action, urging them to fix it.  Urgently.</Person2>
<Person1>More third-level places for therapists, that's one solution she suggests.  Makes sense.</Person1>
<Person2>Definitely. Get 'em young, right?   Career guidance in schools.  Smart.</Person2>
<Person1>Encourage more people into healthcare generally.   I see. Long-term solution.</Person1>
<Person2>It's about the future, right? These kids need help now, but we need more therapists for the future, too.  It's vital. And this assessment of needs?  Crucial step.</Person2>
<Person1>Absolutely crucial.  Shapes their lives, their support.   Well, that's all the time we have for today's PODCASTIFY. Thank you for tuning in, and we hope you'll join us next time for more insightful discussions.  Bye everyone!</Person1>
